    <p>The Nintendo Switch is by far my favorite thing to play video games or watch hulu/youtube on. It is super easy to just pop on the dock to watch something or play a game on the tv, and then pop off the dock to take on a roadtrip and play some 
        Mario Kart 8 Deluxe in the car with your siblings. The de-attachable controllers is a great innovation to gaming today as it allows you to control the system with them attached, and allow two players (one for each controller) to play on the go! This
        also includes the motion controls, 3d rumble, and straps, to make almost anything possible. From playing 1-2 Switch! and feeling the ball rumbling in the controller in the minigames, to playing Super Mario Party and using the motion control mixed in with the 
        3d rumble to sear a steak in a pan for one of their competative party minigames, the Joycon are such an innovation that I personally think is a huge game changer in the console war between Sony, Xbox, and Nintendo.</thead></p>
